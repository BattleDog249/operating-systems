// A function that will track the last 15 characters typed on a keyboard and store them in a buffer for analysis. The function will be called whenever a key is pressed, and will update the buffer with the new keycode.
// If the buffer is full, it will call a separate function to analyze the potential password.
// The buffer will be implemented as a rolling buffer, meaning that once it reaches the maximum length, it will start overwriting the oldest characters with the newest ones.
// The function will also include a red-black tree data structure to store the timestamps and keycodes of each keystroke, allowing for more advanced analysis and potential password recovery.
// The function will also include criteria bitmask constants to check for lowercase, uppercase, number, and symbol characters in the potential password.
// The function will be part of a keylogger program that logs keystrokes on a Linux system.
