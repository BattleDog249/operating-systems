		<h3> CS430 Homework 1:  Linux Kernel Scavanger Hunt </h3>
		<h4> Due Monday, January 29, by the end of the day </h4>

		The Linux kernel source code is available from kernel.org, or on 
isoptera in /usr/src.  It's also available online.  For CS430, you will 
have to become somewhat familiar with this code, with the goal of 
understanding how to program inside an operating system.<br>

		For this week, do a scavanger hunt, where you must find the following:<br>
		<ul>
			<li> 5 places where a function pointer stored in a struct member.  
example:  fs/btrfs/export.c lines 276-282.  These must all be in 
different structure instances, but more than one may be from the same 
type of struct.</li>
			<li> 5 places where a function pointer stored in a struct is used to call a function.  example:  fs/exportfs/expfs.c line 391 </li>
			<li> 5 places where a bitwise operator is used.  example:  arch/x86/pci/common.c line 626</li>
			<li> An amusing comment.  "Amusing" here is highly subjective, and 
you will receive full credit even if I personally am not amused.  
example:  drivers/power/supply/da9052-battery.c lines 345-347 </li>
		</ul>

		The above examples refer to the source code on /usr/src/linux-source-5.10 on isoptera.  This is <i>probably</i>
 the same as the generic Linux 5.10 source code.  In some cases, Linux 
distributions use modified kernel source code, especially when 
specialized.  Generally Linux distributions contain a mechanism to 
obtain the same source code used for the (binary) kernel.  For Debian 
and Ubuntu, It's provided as a package called "linux-source", and this 
is how the source code on isoptera was obtained.  I might have updated 
the kernel on isoptera to a 6-series kernel by the time you do this 
assignment, in which case I'll try to remember to update the references 
above.<br>
		Extensive modification is more likely on distributions such as SteamOS
 or Android, which have a specific purpose other than general computing.<br>

		<h4> Turning in the assignment </h4>

	Upload a file to the "course work uploads" explaining where you found the above items.
